# SyntheticDataset_1

#### Python code 
    - train.tsv: 5,000 records x 254 features + 1 target (~18.0MB)
    - test.tsv : 1,000 records x 254 features            (~ 3.6MB)
Kindly extract the relevant train_test.zip folder for above 2 files

These two synthetic datasets were generated using the same model.
A predictive model has been built using the data in the training dataset to predict the hold out target values from the test set.

The predictions are being provided as a 1,000 x 1 test file containing 1 prediction per line for each record in the test dataset.  
The accuracy of the prediction has been measured by RMSE.

I will be providing the more information related to the dataset on the blog : madoverdata.com
